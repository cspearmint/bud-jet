While our plans aren't too far along yet, we have a basic outline of features to implement:

Overview: Budjet will serve as a financial planner for college students, with a focus on
monthly goals. The goals set by the user will be reinforced through visual representations
such as wheel/pie charts and bar graphs. The app will feature a login system so users can
access their page from anywhere. It will collect transaction information by user input, 
and categorize spending into key groups. Budjet will inform the user when they are approaching
a set budget limit, and may offer ways to keep overall spending in check when this happens.
It will also keep track of under-spending, and have annual/perpetual goals for saved money
that the user can set, such as going on a vacation or making a large purchase, that would be
funded by the leftover money each month.

Speculative features: These are features that were discussed but may not see implementation due
to time contstraints or logistical constraints. Any of these being added would be a victory for
our team:
1. Shared budgets between roommates
2. Reciept scanning to automatically add and categorize transactions
3. Generative AI that suggests financial tips tailored to users
4. Generalized budgeting for all groups of people such as businessowners and homeowners

Framework/Implementation:
Since Budjet will be implemented as a website, it will need to have a frontend, a backend, and
a database. For the frontend, we will utilize JavaScript with React and Node.js, along with HTML/CSS for
formatting purposes. For our backend implementation, we will use Java. For our database, we will
use MySQL.
